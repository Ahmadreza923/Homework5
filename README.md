# Homework5 Day Planner
I Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contain the following:

* The time

* A field to hold user input

* A save button

* A clear button to clear table and makes it ready to reschedule.

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.

This application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.
